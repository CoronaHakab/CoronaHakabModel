# Corona Hakab Simulator

## Run the simulator

- run: **python manager.py**

## Workflow -
- When working, **work on a new git branch**.
- When done, **push changes to your branch, and create a pull request**.
- **Always run the simulator after making changes and before merging**, to make sure you didn't break anything.
- Especially if not sure, **try to get at least 1 person's review before merging**.
