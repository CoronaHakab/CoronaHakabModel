# Corona Hakab Simulator

## Run the simulator
- setup: **python setup.py install**
- go to src/corona_hakab_model folder
- run: **python main.py**
- Optional - Export/Import matrices!
- Export: **python main.py -o <PATH>**
- Import: **python main.py -i <PATH>**

## Workflow -
- When working, **work on a new git branch**.
- run quality test: **tox -e quality**, if it fails you might need to reformat: **tox -e reformat**.
- if you use named expressions := then for now you have to add the comment # flake8: noqa which will exclude the file from flake8 checks because it doens't support namded expressions currently.
- if ** tox -e reformat** fails then we have to check it out...
- When done, **push changes to your branch, and create a pull request**.
- **Always run the simulator after making changes and before merging**, to make sure you didn't break anything.
- Especially if not sure, **try to get at least 1 person's review before merging**.
